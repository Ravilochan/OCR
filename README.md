## ABSTRACT

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used for the purpose of extracting text from an image. The main agenda of an OCR is to make easy viewed & editable documents from existing paper documents or image files. A clean image files can have the accuracy as high as 97.56% by using Tesseract OCR.
Here we developed a web application which simulates a OCR with Tesseract JS, JavaScript version of OCR and also other APIs to convert recognized text to pdf files and even output the text as audio.
This can even help to visually impaired, illiterate, understand the pronunciation of words clear and accurate.

## INTRODUCTION

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a process of classifying optical patterns with respect to alphanumeric or other characters. Optical character recognition process includes segmentation, feature extraction and classification.
Text capture converts analog text based resources to digital text resources and then these converted resources can be used in several ways like searchable text in indexes so as to identify documents or images.
As the first stage of text capture a scanned image of a page is taken. And this scanned copy will form basis for all other stages. The very next stage involves implementation of technology Optical Character Recognition for converting text content into machine understandable or readable format.
OCR analysis takes the input as digital image and converts it to machine readable digital text format. Then OCR processes the digital image into small components for analysis of finding text or word or character blocks. And again the character blocks are further broken into components and are compared with dictionary of characters. Accuracy rates are measured in several ways and the ways they are measured impact the accuracy rate.








## Problem Statement:
A system cannot read or recognize any text directly from an image. So we are using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), an open-source Tesseract OCR Engine, to detect text from images and using other APIs outputting the recognized text from the images in PDF files and as audio using text-to-speech API.

## Existing System:
In the world there is a growing demand for the users to convert the printed documents into electronic documents for proper, easy maintenance and security. Hence the basic OCR system which was invented to convert the data available on the papers into computer process able documents, so that the documents can be editable and reusable. The existing system or the previous system of OCR on a grid infrastructure is just an OCR without grid functionality and other functionality to convert the text into pdf files and listen to the text in the form of audio. That is the existing system deals with the homogeneous character recognition or character recognition of any single language.

## Proposed System:
The proposed system is a Text Recognition using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) named Tesseract, which is open-source software released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006. 
Open –Source: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract.git

## Scope:
The system transforms printed and documented text on any kind of form/format in an image the text can be on plain paper or else on pre-printed form. The scanned document, which will be in the image format, will be the input.  This scanned image undergoes pre-processing and all the text in the scanned images will be outputted in the form of text, PDF file and also in audio format.



## 	Goals:
Goal of this project is to develop a system that focuses on following major criteria:
•	Recognizing every text in images
•	Efficient and automated storing of text documents.
•	Increased accuracy & Reduced Time for recording text.
•	Reduced Manual Burden for scanning and storing.
•	Make data available for long time without any loss.

## 	Applications:
Application areas of this system are very large as in many organizations.
For Example:
•	E-Governance.
•	Government organizations. 
•	Administrative Offices.
•	Off-line competitive examination management system.
•	Many statutory forms/results prepared in various organizations.
•	To save the efforts to make a copy of paper documents and files digitally. 
•	We can just use the OCR to convert images of paper documents to digital files.
•	To be helpful for visually impaired and illiterate.
•	To helpful for knowing the correct pronunciation of words. 
•	Take a picture of word and this can read out the correct & accurate pronunciation         of that words.
•	To help people in hear the paper documents in audio.




##  LITERATURE SURVEY

According to a SRS document which details OCR system and explains the requirements of working of OCR. It provides an introduction to this concept and also provides a full description of the system along with a detailed list of requirements for the building of the OCR system. It lists all the functions performed by the system. It concerns the details of the requirement model for the OCR for Text Recognition.
OCR is a complex technology that converts images with text into editable formats. OCR allows you to process scanned books, screenshots and photos with text and get editable documents like TXT, DOC or PDF files. This technology is widely used in many areas and the most advanced OCR systems can handle almost all types of images, even such complex as scanned magazine pages with images and columns or photos from just a mobile phone.

## 	SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND METHODOLOGIES
Tesseract.js wraps an emscripten port of the Tesseract OCR Engine. It works in the browser using web pack or plain script tags with a CDN and on the server with Node.js. 
### Step 1:

import Tesseract from 'tesseract.js';

Tesseract.recognize(
  'https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png',
  'eng',
  { logger: m => console.log(m) }
).then(({ data: { text } }) => {
  console.log(text);
})

### Step 2: 

import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

const worker = createWorker({
  logger: m => console.log(m)
});

(async () => {
  await worker.load();
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker.initialize('eng');
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png');
  console.log(text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();

### Step 3:  with progress.

import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

const worker = createWorker({
  logger: m => console.log(m), // Add logger here
});

(async () => {
  await worker.load();
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker.initialize('eng');
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png');
  console.log(text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();

 ### Step 4: if multiple languages.

import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

const worker = createWorker();

(async () => {
  await worker.load();
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng+chi_tra');
  await worker.initialize('eng+chi_tra');
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png');
  console.log(text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();


 ### Step 5: with whitelist char.

 import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

const worker = createWorker();

(async () => {
  await worker.load();
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker.initialize('eng');
  await worker.setParameters({
    tessedit_char_whitelist: '0123456789',
  });
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png');
  console.log(text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();

### Step 6 : with different pageseg modes.
import { createWorker, PSM } from 'tesseract.js';

const worker = createWorker();

(async () => {
  await worker.load();
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker.initialize('eng');
  await worker.setParameters({
    tessedit_pageseg_mode: PSM.SINGLE_BLOCK,
  });
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png');
  console.log(text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();


### Step 7: with one part of image.

import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

const worker = createWorker();
const rectangles = [
  { left: 0, top: 0, width: 500, height: 250 },
];

(async () => {
  await worker.load();
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker.initialize('eng');
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png', 'eng', { rectangles });
  console.log(text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();

### Step 8: with multiple workers to speed up.
import { createWorker, createScheduler } from 'tesseract.js';

const scheduler = createScheduler();
const worker1 = createWorker();
const worker2 = createWorker();

(async () => {
  await worker1.load();
  await worker2.load();
  await worker1.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker2.loadLanguage('eng');
  await worker1.initialize('eng');
  await worker2.initialize('eng');
  scheduler.addWorker(worker1);
  scheduler.addWorker(worker2);
  /** Add 10 recognition jobs */
  const results = await Promise.all(Array(10).fill(0).map(() => (
    await scheduler.addJob('recognize', 'https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng_bw.png')
  )))
  console.log(results);
  await scheduler.terminate(); // It also terminates all workers.
})();

## 	TESTING
The testing phase of the implementation is simple and straightforward. Since the program is coded into modular parts the same routines that were used to load, analyze and compute network parameters of input vectors in the training phase can be reused in the testing phase as well.
The basic steps in testing input images for characters can be summarized as follows:
•	load image file
•	analyze image for characters
•	for each character line detect consecutive character symbols
o	analyze and process 
o	feed input vector to OCR Engine and compute output
o	convert the Unicode binary output to the corresponding character and render to a text box
o	Display the text in a page
o	Output the text recognized as an audio 
o	Create a PDF file of the text in the image input.
o	Download the PDF.


## CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Conclusion:
  Our Project is recognizing the text from the images. So it has input of scan printed document like that image of scan documents is converted to text form according to user scanned image. Thus our project looked upon the problems faced by Educational Institutes, for storing data which is in Printed format. It helped in reducing manual burden and is also less time consuming. This software can also be used for any kind of format of printed documents to recognize text in the images and output the text in PDF file format and audio format outputs.  Thus not only Educational Institutes are benefited by this but also the government offices or any other organizations using such printed documents are benefited.
  By Text Recognizer using OCR, We can achieve a way of recognizing text within images, faster and simple and convert them into pdfs and can listen to that text in audio. This is a useful way for helping blind and visually impaired people.
 We looked upon various algorithms and techniques for preprocessing and character recognition from an image and implemented most optimal ones amongst them, thus resulting in more speed and accuracy.  
  This makes our project dynamic and is feasible for any kind of organization.
  We reached all our goals and statement of purpose of the project.

### Future Enhancements:

  This project can be further extended for recognizing handwritten documents. This software can be further upgraded in which functionality can be added to train handwriting of a particular individual and then can be used to recognize documents written by that individual. Also software can be trained to recognize handwriting of multiple individuals and also different fonts. There is also scope of increasing accuracy of the recognizer so that no manual watch should be needed on the software other than inputting the data.
  All the data recognized by the OCR can be formulated and entered into a database, which makes it more secure, redundant and easily accessible and useful. This can make use to convert normal images into database data. Normal text documents data can be easily migrated into a database.
  For Business purpose all the resumes, letters, complaints sent to a company can be directly entered into a database without the huge load and necessity for data entry jobs. This can decrease the money spent on Manuka labor and time.
  Thus software can be atomized to a higher level.
